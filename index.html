            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Born and raised in New York, I went to Thomas A Edsion High School where I joined the schools robotics team. I was able to
            learn the theory behind direct current, alternating current, semiconductors and materials/tools. For the robotic season we had
            built a robot and brought it to the annual competition in Jacob Javed Center. Even though we did not do great, it did lead me to the
            field of engineering. I started my college career as a civil engineering student which did not last long and finally led me to become
            a computer science student.</p>
            <p>After getting my bachelors degree, I was able to get a job down in Maryland as a Programmer Analyst for a company that managed data for
            <abbr title="National Institute of Health">NIH</abbr> and <abbr title="National Cancer Institute">NCI</abbr>. The data collected by these two institutions
            are from different clinical trials about drugs preventing cancer recurrence. My main duties included: take new data and flag errors, document
            variable types and mapping them to proper form questions, and creating a timeline of the data. After being accepted to graduate school at Stevens Institute of Technology,
            I moved back home at the end of the year.</p>

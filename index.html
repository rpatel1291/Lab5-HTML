            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p style="text-indent:2em;">
                Born and raised in New York, I went to Thomas A Edsion High School where I joined the schools robotics team. I was able to
                learn the theory behind direct current, alternating current, semiconductors and materials/tools. For the robotic season we had
                built a robot and brought it to the annual competition in Jacob Javed Center. Even though we did not do great, it did lead me to the
                field of engineering. I started my college career as a civil engineering student which did not last long and finally led me to become
                a computer science student.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent:2em;">
                After getting my bachelors degree, I was able to get a job down in Maryland as a Programmer Analyst for a company that managed data for
                <abbr title="National Institute of Health">NIH</abbr> and <abbr title="National Cancer Institute">NCI</abbr>. The data collected by these two institutions
                are from different clinical trials about drugs preventing cancer recurrence. My main duties included: take new data and flag errors, document
                variable types and mapping them to proper form questions, and creating a timeline of the data. After being accepted to graduate school at Stevens Institute of Technology,
                I moved back home at the end of the year.

                <p>My <em>favorite class</em> in the school was the Robotics</p>
                <aside>
                    <p>During the four years in high school, I had to take a technical class for three years instead of a foreign language class.
                    I choose <strong>Robotics</strong> because the final project was to build a functioning robot to take to an annual competition. The whole building
                    season was only six weeks long but we spent many hours after school thinking of ways to find solutions to problems. However, we end up having
                    more problems than we started with.</p>

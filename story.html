            <p >After completing my bachelors from Queens College at the end of 2015, I spent the first few weeks studying to take the GRE for graduate school.
            After the exam I went directly home to packed my bags and headed to the airport the next day to go to India. This was the first vacation I taken 
            ever since I graduated high school back in 2010. The few weeks in India was a way to recharge my batteries and to relax after serveral semesters 
            of stress. However, the vacation was coming to an end and I knew the stress was going to begin again. </p>

            <p>Coming back home after a few weeks of relaxation, I was preparing myself to apply for jobs like my life dependented on it. I would take a few hours
            every morning to look at job postings and apply to the ones in the city. From the jobs I applied to, all I received were rejection letters. The despairation 
            starting to grow. I began looking at all of the pros and cons of what I wanted to do and how far I was willing to travel. My main preference was looking for 
            a position half an hour to an hour travel. However, the best idea was to expand my search area and took a random chance at a company. Turned out that company
            was located in Maryland.</p>

            <p>Having a year spent at home searching for a job, I was accepted for a full time position and started that December. I was asked to look for a place and be 
            ready to work the first Monday of the month. Waiting to the last minute, I found an apartment a week before I started work. As I started work, I was able to hop
            onto a new project the company received and basically worked on it for almost 11 months continuously. However, progress was very slow. Everytime there was a step 
            forward two to three steps were taken back. That is when I thought going back to school or looking for a new job was the best path.</p>

            <p>After completing my bachelors from Queens College at the end of 2015, I spent the first few weeks studying to take the GRE for graduate school.
            After the exam I went directly home to packed my bags and headed to the airport the next day to go to India. This was the first vacation I taken 
            ever since I graduated high school back in 2010. The few weeks in India was a way to recharge my batteries and to relax after serveral semesters 
            of stress. However, the vacation was coming to an end and I knew the stress was going to begin again. </p>
